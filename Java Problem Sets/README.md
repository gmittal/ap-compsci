# Problem Sets
Homework exercises (some based on the SICP curriculum, some not) written in Java. I think the idea is that this allows us to apply our understanding of computer science concepts learned from SICP to a more advanced language (debatable) with more complex data structures.

Also, the AP Computer Science Exam requires knowledge of Java, so knowing the language might be helpful when that fateful time of year during the first week of May comes around.
