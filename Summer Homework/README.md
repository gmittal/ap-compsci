# AP Computer Science Summer Homework
*Summer 2016*. There are two kinds of students who enter AP Computer Science at Gunn High School. Those who have taken the prerequisites, and those who haven't. I happen to be part of the latter. If you belong to the group that hasn't completed the other computer science courses at Gunn, you must complete the [summer homework](paleyontology.com/AP_CS/entrance.html).

### Running the Code
The ```SummerHomework.java``` can be run with any standard Java IDE (Eclipse, Atom, etc.) and ```SummerHomework.scm``` can be run using [DrScheme](http://download.plt-scheme.org/doc/html/drscheme/). Conway must be imported and executed using [Processing](https://processing.org/).
