# Maze Pathfinder
Not a Stanford Nifty assignment, but this is one of the projects that @CrazyAZ and I built during the first semester. Uses Breadth First Search (with early termination), as [described by Amit Patel on Red Blob Games](http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html), to calculate the shortest path in a maze.
