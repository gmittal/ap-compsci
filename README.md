# AP Computer Science
Code written by [Gautam Mittal](https://github.com/gmittal) and [Aaron Schultz](https://github.com/CrazyAZ). 

For the 2016-17 academic year, Aaron Schultz and I have been paired up as lab partners in our first official computer science class. We've decided to dump all code, resources, and thoughts in this nifty git repo for reference purposes. 

This is mostly random snippets of Java, Scheme, and Processing code written during the course. Course content from [Gunn High School AP Computer Science](http://paleyontology.com). The course is based on [UC Berkeley's CS61A](http://cs61a.org/).
