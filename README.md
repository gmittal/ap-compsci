# AP Computer Science
For the 2016-17 academic year, I have decided to take my first official computer science class. I've decided to dump all code, resources, and thoughts in this nifty git repo for reference purposes. 

This is mostly random snippets of Java and Scheme code written by someone who knows neither of the two launguages. Course content from [Gunn High School AP Computer Science](http://paleyontology.com). The course content is based on [UC Berkeley's CS61A](http://cs61a.org/) course.

### License
As mentioned earlier, the course content comes from [Gunn High School](http://paleyontology.com) as adapted from the Berkeley CS61A course. Thus, this (informal) license only applies to snippets of code that I have written. _To those interested in copying code to cheat in the class: don't do it._

You can use my code for whatever you like, so long as you do not reuse it to cheat in your AP Computer Science (or college introductory CS class??) class. I do not have any jurisdiction over the Gunn AP Computer Science course content. Those with inquiries regarding the curriculum should contact [the course instructor](http://paleyontology.com).
