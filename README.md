# AP Computer Science
Code written by [Gautam Mittal](https://github.com/gmittal) and [Aaron Schultz](https://github.com/CrazyAZ). 

For the 2016-17 academic year, I have decided to take my first official computer science class. I've decided to dump all code, resources, and thoughts in this nifty git repo for reference purposes. 

This is mostly random snippets of Java and Scheme code written by someone who knows neither of the two launguages. Course content from [Gunn High School AP Computer Science](http://paleyontology.com). The course content is based on [UC Berkeley's CS61A](http://cs61a.org/) course.
